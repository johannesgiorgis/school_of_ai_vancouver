    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is an open source cross platform package management system and environment management system. Conda allow us to set up separate environments, called virtual environments and helps us manage the necessary packages we need within each environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is extremely useful for Data Scientists as it allows them to write down their thoughts, documentation right next to the code and its output.  It is part of Project Jupyter."
