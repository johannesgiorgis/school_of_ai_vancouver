    "Welcome to the School of AI's Introduction to Data Science Tools series. This series will serve as an introduction to the various Data Science tools and ecosystem that are at our disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be covering:\n",
    "    - Conda (package and environment management system)\n",
    "    - Jupyter\n",
    "    - NumPy (Numeric computing)\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial workshop will focus on:\n",
    "    - installing conda\n",
    "    - setting up a conda virtual environment\n",
    "    - installing and using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "    - using NumPy for Statistics within a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a brief look at the tools we will be learning about today:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is an open source cross platform package and environment management system. Conda allow us to set up separate environments, called virtual environments and helps us manage the necessary packages we need within each environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is extremely useful for Data Scientists as it allows them to write down their thoughts and documentation right next to the code and its output. In fact, you are reading this on a Jupyter Notebook :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy\n",
    "[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (Numeric Python) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "    - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "    - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    "    - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",

    "    - [Anaconda installer for Windows.](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)  \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Follow the instructions on the screen. \n",
    "    If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.  \n",
    "    When installation is finished, from the Start menu, open the Anaconda Prompt.  \n",

    "\n",
    "    If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To make the changes take effect, close and then re-open your Terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Test your installation:  \n",
    "    Run the command ```conda list``` from the Terminal Window or Anaconda Prompt.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Installing on Linux\n",

    "A virtual environment is an isolated container of dependencies. You create different virtual environments to install different types of dependencies or even different versions of the same dependency. This way, adding or removing dependencies in one virtual environment has zero effect in another virtual environment. Conda allows you to manage - create, export, list, remove and update - environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you wish to work on multiple projects - one project that uses Python 3.6 while another uses Python 3.7. Your Python 3.6 project uses Tensorflow v0.9 and your Python 3.7 project uses Tensorflow v1.11. The APIs between the two Tensorflow versions are very different. Because each conda virtual environment is completely isolated, you can update packages in one virtual environment with no fear of over-writing or breaking packages in any other virtual environment.\n",
